A emulator for ARM programs. 

Aim to run ARM programs(Thumb mode) in x86 platform.
Support:
 - virtual memory
 - dynamic memory allocation (heap)
 - file read and write
 - keyboard read and screen write

Currently only Thumb mode code is supported, which means 
you have to use "arm-elf-gcc -mthumb -Bstatic <source> -o <executable>"
to generate binary files.
